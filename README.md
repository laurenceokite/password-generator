# Password Generator 
## Upon clicking 'Generate Password' the site prompts you to choose password length. If length is a valid number between 8 and 128 the program gives you the option to use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Based on these inputs a random set of characters (your password) is generated.
